              What are your future plans for our drama club?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              In the immediate future we will audition for our spring production when we return from Christmas break. In general we hope to continue to provide entertaining and thought-provoking work of the highest quality that showcases the talent
              of the students at Madison Academic.

              Anyone who is a student at Madison Academic Magnet High School is welcome to audition for our productions however we do stress that being a part of a play is a serious commitment. With three to four rehearsals a week after school for
              the duration of the rehearsal process (usually 6-8 weeks). Students need to understand the amount of time required to participate in a MADrama production.

              What helps the most with prepartions?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Effort. Consistency. Momentum. As with everything in life the more a person is willing to dedicate themselves to a task the more rewarding for them and the greater the outcome for any and all involved-including the audience coming to
              view the performances. The director can only do so much in the way of suggestion and advice, the actor themselves must take ownership of their role and engage themselves fully.

            <dd>
              I encourage the crew members to watch as many rehearsals as possible. The more familiar the crew is with the show the smoother all of the technical aspects of the show will be. Of course our crew and tech people can come in the week
              before the show and do a fine job with their various responsibilities but I like for everyone involved with a show to feel as though they have a stake in its outcome, again a since of responsibility and ownership of our collective work.
