              is a coming of age story about a family in the 1960's. The eldest son is plagued by the threat of polio. In 2005, students performed their highly successful <var>Little Shop of Horrors.</var>
              In 2006, students performed <var>The Cover of Life.</var> It takes place in Louisiana where 3 women live with their mother-in-law while their husbands, the three Cliffert brothers, are at war. In the spring,
              the Theatre Department put on the play, <var>Er</var>, which was about a day in the lives of emergency room doctors. </p>

              were qualified for the state competition in Johnson City, Tenessee. During the spring, they performed the musical, <var>The Apple Tree</var>. This performance featured a huge cast and told
              three stories. The first was a twist of Adam and Eve, the second a forbidden love story, and the third a 60s-era Cinderella story, all told through music. In Spring of 2008, the Madison
              Theatre Department performed <var>Grease</var> which was a highly anticipated musical. </p>
