# DramaClub
 Website for MAHS Drama Club

A website created by Cassidy Dyer, Monzerath Soriano, and Grace Winters. We are all seniors at Madison Academic High School in Jackson, Tennessee. We created a website for our school's drama program. We contacted Mr. Young and asked for his permission to do the website. He, of course, said yes. We had to contact different students and teachers for information to use on our website. We even had to go see our school's live production of Shrek the Musical during our fall semester. Our drama program has had two directors throughout Madison's time, Ms.Fly and Mr. Young.

The website

Our website is every easy to navigate on all devices. Everything you need is right there. We made it to where you can access everything from our homepage. We designed our homepage to be the same style of a classic movie theatre. We added a giant movie sign at the top center of our page with play posters to give even more of a movie theatre vibe. In the bottom left corner, we added a mini introduction given to us by Mr. Young himself. Beside that we added another Shrek the Musical performance trailer, to give the audience a general idea of what to expect. Right beside the video, we put another poster for the upcoming play. At the bottom of all our pages, we have added a footer which has links to different pages and Mr. Young's email.

We customized our own MADrama logo and made it to where when you click on it, it brings you back to the homepage. We included the logo on our footer as well. For our background, we chose a simple gray pattern because we didn't want to hurt the user's eyes by having to much going on.  

For our about us page, we separated it into 3 sections: director, cast members, and backstage crew. For each section, we had Mr. Young give a brief description on what we plans to do with them and how he wants to improve as a director. For our third page, we made it into a calendar page so that the crew and audience and keep up with dates and performance times. We simply made a calendar using google calendars and edited it with all the dates.

For our history page, we made a timeline and had to look into past yearbooks and insert what they made into the timeline. The timeline is to give a general description on what MADrama has done in the past and what we're capable of.

Our original idea, for our last page was a buy now page for customers to buy play tickets there, but we found out that they sell the tickets at the door so that page was pointless, so we made it into an academics page. We contacted Mr. Young and had him send us syllabuses from each of his classes to give his students a basic idea of what to expect. 

Thank you for taking time to look at our website.
